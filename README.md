# abstracted-wallet
This is a concept design for an abstracted web3 wallet, making heavy use of Account Abstraction and Chain Abstraction. It is meant as an open source exploration for what is possible with upcoming infrastructure movements in web3 and how it can impact the end-user UX.

This is a free and open source contribution of some old work I made back in 2022 when I was first exploring the abstraction concept. Feel free to use it, and remix it, attributions are appreciated.
